# python-challenge

In this challenge, I was tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of my company using the corporate financial data. My task was to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following: 
-- The total number of months included in the dataset, 
-- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, 
-- The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, 
-- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period, 
-- The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

The final output looks like this:
